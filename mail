Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding the upcoming Family Day event scheduled for the 27th of October. Unfortunately, I have a prior commitment on that day, and I would like to kindly request if it would be possible for me and my family to attend the event on the 26th of October instead.

Please let me know if this adjustment can be accommodated, or if there are any further steps I need to take.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
